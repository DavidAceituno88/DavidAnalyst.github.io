						<h2>Trades School Aanalysis</h2>
						<p>The skilled trades shortage crisis</p>
					</header>
					<div class="box">
						
						<h3>Case of study</h3>
						<p><i>Looking ahead, it is unlikely the issue will be resolved without more 
							intervention from government, unions and trade associations, he says. 
							If the current situation doesn’t improve, Canada could be facing a 
							shortage of 100,000 tradespeople by 2029</i>- Kieran Hawe, chief operating
							 officer of construction services company EllisDon Corp.(1)
						</p>
						<p>
							Well, this goes far beyond your state, province, or your country, 
							this is a worldwide scenario now. Yes, the <b>Skilled Trade Crisis.</b> 
							Some experts say that the main cause is the lack of interest from 
							the new generations in the Trades since now you can get "easier" 
							jobs that will be less physically demanding, others say that now 
							everyone wants to become an Online Celebrity, and so on.
						</p>
						<p>
							The truth is that regardless of the many reasons we can come up with,
							 we need to have actual data that reveals the reasons behind this crisis; 
							 that's why I worked together with the Trades School of the city where 
							 I used to live (this is a 2021 analysis, I was living in Mexico at that time).
						</p>			
						<p>
							The Trades School had <b> 4 Goals / Questions:</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>1.- What is the median age of our students?</b></li>
								<li><b>2.- What was their motivation to join the school?</b></li>
								<li><b>3.- How did they get to know about our courses?</b></li>
								<li><b>4.- How can we be more efficient in recruiting more students?</b></li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							So the school during the pandemic had an online registration website 
							that stored all of their registered students on a Data Base and that's 
							what they gave me.
						</p>							
							<p>
							<img src="images/trade school/raw data.png" width="100%">
							</p>
						</p>
						<p>
							<p>
								This .csv file had all the information about the student, some key fields
								 were the Date when they registered for the course, the name of the course, 
								 age, gender if they had a job, motive for joining the trades school, 
								 how did they find out about the courses, etc. So first I had to rename 
								 most of the fields, and join others, this is my query (a very simple one).
							</p>
							<p>
								<div>
							<img src="images/trade school/query.png" width="100%">
						</div>
							</p>							
								<p>
									Now with that, i got all that i needed to create a Power Bi dashboard.
								</p>							
						
						<h3>The BI Dashboard</h3>
						
						<iframe title="TradesSchoolAnalysisCECATI 83 Dashboard" width="100%" height="600" src="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTliY2M4YmMtOGJjOS00MzczLThiY2UtNGExNTg3ZGY4NjNlIiwidCI6IjJkMzliNTI5LTU0NmEtNDJhOC1iNmVmLTlhOTJmZGRiYTMwZSJ9" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>								
						<br/>
								<h3>The results</h3>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Median age:</b> 31 years</li>
										<li><b>Reasons why</b> they joined the trades school: Self improvement, To get a Job and Improve actual job salary(position). Those where the main reasons with Self Improvement being the bigest of them all 67%.</li>
										<li><b>How did they find out</b> about the courses? Friends and Family, other and via Internet.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<h3>How can we be more efficient in recruiting more students?</h3>
								<p>Given the results of the analysis, we can take different paths or different 
									approaches to this question. Since most of the people (at least in that city)
									 knew about the school because of <b>Friends</b> it will be a good idea to create a 
									 strategy that involves <b>human interaction</b>, like giving discounts if you 
									 invite or get a friend or relative to join one of the courses, given that 
									 the person to person publicity seems to be, by far, the most efficient one.
								</p>
									<h4>Example</h4> 
								<p>Now, the areas with the most interest and number of students are  
										<u>Web and Mobile Applications development</u>, <u>Electrician</u>, <u>Welding</u>, 
										<u>English</u>, and <u>Carpentry</u>. 
										So let's say that we want to promote even more the Web and Mobile Applications 
										development course by looking at the statistics we can see that the potential 
										student will be a <b>Female</b>, <b>36 years old</b>, <b>unemployed</b> who wants to 
										<b>improve herself</b>. 
										That will give the school an idea of  <u>how to create a good publicity campaign</u>.
								</p>
									  <p>
										<img src="images/trade school/mobile1.png" width="100%">
										<img src="images/trade school/mobile2.png" width="100%">
									</p>
									  <p >
										<b>Or</b> let's say that the city told the school that there is a crisis in the <u>welding</u> or 
										<u>carpentry</u> trades, and they need to increase the number of students in those areas. 
										Then the school should focus on <b>Males</b> in their 
										<b>late 20s</b> or <b>early 30s</b> who are unemployed and want to
										<b>Improve themselves</b>  or <b>get a job</b>.
										<img src="images/trade school/elecarp.png" width="100%" >
										<img src="images/trade school/elecarp2.png" width="100%" >
									</p>
									<p>
										They should also take into consideration that  <b>the month with the most number 
										of registrations is August</b> and that it would be a good idea if they invite 
										students to promote the trades within their social circle.
									</p>

									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								<p>This case of study might not be the same scenario of what's 
									happening in other parts of the world, but it is, in my opinion, 
									a great start for other countries that want to take action on this Crisis. 
									There is a great difference between having an idea of why, and knowing why. 
									I do believe that we, of course, need to motivate the new generations to
									 discover a love for the trades, but we must also know how to do it in the most
									  efficient ways so that soon we can overcome this crisis, and get that leaking
									   ceiling fixed.
